# Streamlit Diff Checker Application Design

## Overview
This application will provide a user-friendly interface for comparing text and code files, similar to Beyond Compare. Users will be able to upload files or folders, view differences, make changes in either direction, and generate reconciled output files.

## Core Components

### 1. File and Folder Upload
- Dual-pane interface with left and right sides
- Support for uploading individual files or entire folders
- File browser for selecting files within uploaded folders
- File type filtering for text and code files

### 2. Diff Generation and Visualization
- Line-by-line comparison of text files
- Syntax highlighting for code files
- Color-coded differences (additions, deletions, modifications)
- Scrollable and synchronized view of both files

### 3. Editing and Reconciliation
- Controls to move changes from left to right or right to left
- Line-level and block-level selection for changes
- Preview of reconciled output
- Conflict resolution interface

### 4. Output Generation
- Generation of reconciled files
- Download functionality for reconciled files
- Option to save files to project directory
- Batch processing for folder comparisons

## Technical Architecture

### Dependencies
- Streamlit: For the web application framework
- Difflib: Python's built-in library for generating diffs
- Pygments: For syntax highlighting of code files
- Zipfile: For handling folder uploads and downloads
- Tempfile: For managing temporary files during processing
- Shutil: For file operations

### File Structure
```
streamlit_diff_checker/
├── app.py                  # Main Streamlit application
├── requirements.txt        # Project dependencies
├── utils/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── diff_utils.py       # Diff generation and processing
│   ├── file_utils.py       # File handling utilities
│   └── ui_utils.py         # UI components and helpers
├── static/                 # CSS and other static assets
└── output/                 # Directory for saved reconciled files
```

### Data Flow
1. User uploads files/folders to both panes
2. Application generates diff between selected files
3. User views differences and selects changes to apply
4. Application generates reconciled output
5. User downloads reconciled file or saves to project directory

## UI Design
- Clean, modern interface with two main panes
- File browser sidebar for navigating uploaded folders
- Diff view with line numbers and syntax highlighting
- Action buttons for reconciliation operations
- Download and save controls
- Status indicators for processing operations

## Implementation Approach
1. Start with basic file upload and diff visualization
2. Add folder support and file navigation
3. Implement editing and reconciliation features
4. Add output generation and download functionality
5. Enhance UI and add advanced features
6. Implement error handling and edge cases
